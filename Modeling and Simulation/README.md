# MODELING AND SIMULATION LAB

1.Simulate exponential decay using MS EXCEL?
	I = I₀
	where I is the intensity at time t, I₀ is the initial intensity at time t=0 and τ is lifetime

2.Simulate any one of the random number test -
	2.1 Chi square test
	2.2 kolmogorov - smirnov test

3. Generate random no by -
	3.1 Mid square method 
	3.2 Linear cogruential method {Residue method}

4.Simulate monte carlo simulation

5.simulation of single server queuing system
NOTE- Only 1st simulation should be done in excel where as rest of the simulations can be simulate in any IDE.
